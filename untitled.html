to see recent commits (git log)
to see status like modified etc(git status)
to add to staging area(git add .)(this should be done after modifications in the file)
to commit message after adding(git commit -m "message")(to push to local repository)
to push to online repository(git push origin main)
///  (#vgj2r56976 )commits only hold that particular change but linked to the previous commits like a pointer
/// everytime after modification of file we only push that particular change or modification to the online 
repository from the local repository, that is why commits hold that particular change  
/// every commit have parents except first commit (parents are nothing but the number of commitds done before
that particular commit)
/// finally done commit is called as head
to get list of commits all we have done(git log --oneline)
to know what is modified in our file after last commit (git diff)
to know the modification between two commits(git diff 38y65465 778987t6)
to create a new brach(git branch <branch name>)
to navigate current location to the particular branch(git checkout <branch name>)
if we want to merge any branch to the current branch(git merge <branch you want to merge>)
the above command merges branches locally to update in repository we have to use command again
(git push origin <branch name>)
if we want to delete any branch(git branch -d <branchname>)
after the above command that branch is deleted locally to delete it in repository we should use 
the command(git push origin --delete <branch name>)
